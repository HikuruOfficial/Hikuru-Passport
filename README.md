- **Minting**: Offers two minting functions, one standard and one with referral rewards, facilitating the creation of new digital passports while incentivizing community growth.
- **User Type Determination**: Analyzes user scores to categorize participants into different tiers, such as "sybil," "human," and "crypto enthusiast," enriching the ecosystem's dynamics.
- **Administrative Controls**: Provides powerful tools for owners to manage URIs, update minting fees, modify the whitelist, and adjust user scores, ensuring adaptability and governance.
- **Ownership and Whitelist Management**: Enables the addition and removal of owners and whitelist members, granting flexibility in access and control.

### Security and Ownership

Ensuring the highest standards of security and governance, the contract employs modifiers and checks to restrict sensitive operations to authorized owners. This approach safeguards the contract against unauthorized access and malicious activities.

### Conclusion

The HikuruPassport contract represents a sophisticated blend of technology and strategy, aimed at creating a secure, scalable, and engaging digital passport ecosystem. By combining ERC1155's efficiency, Ownable's security, and ERC1155Supply's clarity, alongside innovative features like the referral system, Hikuru Labs sets a new standard for blockchain-based digital identities.
